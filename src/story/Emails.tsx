We're stoked to have you back.\n\nI figured today you'd be catching up on email and whatnot so don't want to over-burden you, but if you have a second, I'm doing some analysis--could you take a look at the PTO data in X-Lerate and let me know how many TLOs were filled out last month.\n\n Best,\nSteve Cahill, CPA"
