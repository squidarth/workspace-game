# Workspace

Workspace is a fun interactive game where the story
plays out through somebody's work space -- their emails,
their chat messages, their spreadsheets.

It's a work-in-progress, and I'm excited to see where it goes!

## Development

Workspace is a React app, that uses Firebase as the backend.
In order to get this working, you'll need to set up a project
on Firebase, and replace the credentials in this project with
those credentials.

For the Javascript part of this, you can start a development
server using:
```bash
$ yarn start
```

## Deployment

```
$ firebase deploy
```
